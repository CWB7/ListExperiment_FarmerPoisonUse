# ListExperiment_FarmerPoisonUse
Study investigating poison-use under commercial farmers in South Africa using a specialized social science questionnaire technique.

The use of poison to eliminate predators is causing African vulture populations to collapse. To understand the prevalence and motivations of this practice we conducted an extensive survey with South African commercial farmers. We used a specialized questioning technique, the list experiment (also known as the unmatched count technique), to acquire unbiased data for what is an illegal and therefore sensitive behavior.Farmers were questioned about whether they have used poison over the past year and separately whether they have used poison in the last five years. Seperate anlaysis were conducted for the one year and the five year peroids.

I am not able to share the data at this time but please refer to Brink et al. 2021 "Prevalence and drivers of poison use by South African commercial farmers and perceptions of alternative livestock protection measures" in the journal Ambio. (https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01461-2) to review the results.

Below I analyse this data using various modeling approaches to determine poisoning prevalence, predict the probability of individual respondents using poison, determine the main predictors of poison use and examine farmer attitudes to alternative solutions for livestock losses.Analysis follows the methods of the following papers:
- "List Experiments with Measurement Error" Blair and Imai 2019, Political Analysis
- "Statistical Analysis of List Experiments" Blair and Imai 2012, Political Analysis
- "Multivariate regression analysis for the item count technique" Imai 2011, Political Analysis

Originally Maximum Likelihood models were attempted but these struggled to converge and a non-linear least squares approach was adopted.
